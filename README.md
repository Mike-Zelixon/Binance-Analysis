# Binance-Analysis
Repo with scripts on how to work with Binance API to analyze your trading data &amp; history 

Binance is great for crypto trading but terrible for giving you insight into your trades.

I have created a series of scripts that will take a raw Binance trading history and turn it into an organized CSV with insightfu statistics to better understand your trades.

You will need to have a Binance API key and download the data manually first before uploading it to use with some of the scripts. 

There are two scripts here that are of use to any active crypto trader.

1. TradeHistoryFromExcel - let's you take a raw excel from Binance history and turn it into a fully readable and undertandable dataframe. 

2. LatestFuturesTradesAPI - if you're an active futures trader you can summarize your latest trades using only your API keys instead of relying on the Binance UI (quite terrible for data analysis, hence this repository and code)

3. Latest_Trades - a more efficient script that lets you fetch your latet traddes from whatever specified date(s) you desire. No need to go to the Binance website and download an Excel beforehand.
