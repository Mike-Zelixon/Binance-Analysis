# Binance-Analysis
Repo with scripts on how to work with Binance API to analyze your trading data &amp; history 

Binance is great for crypto trading but terrible for giving you insight into your trades.

I have created a series of scripts that will take a raw Binance trading history and turn it into an organized CSV with insightfu statistics to better understand your trades.

You will need to have a Binance API key and download the data manually first before uploading it to use with some of the scripts.
